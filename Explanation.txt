If i was in a large backend i will structure my project like this :
- services/weather_service.py : Contains the function fetch_weather that interacts with OpenWeather API.

controllers/weather_controller.py : Calls the service function, handles user requests, and formats responses for the frontend.

models/weather_model.py : Defines a data model (e.g., WeatherData) for storing and validating weather information.

Error handling & logging : Use a centralized error handler and logging system to track API failures.
